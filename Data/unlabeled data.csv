3,0,@EddieEddington2 The final eight weeks of 2015.
4,0,"@alexdeejames Not weird. Manny Machado was a big comp at the time, in large part because of the Miami connection that A-Rod also shares."
5,0,"@letsgomets129 I'm not anointing anyone. Full season matter, I couldn't agree more. I just don't understand why there tends to be so much vitriol on this web site when anyone pays the man a compliment."
6,0,"Co-sign on this. Rojas is one of the league's most thoughtful managers in terms of in-game strategy. Doesn't mean he's always right. Doesn't mean it always works. But there's always a logical thought process.  Plus, the Mets have been in first place for 8+ consecutive weeks."
7,0,@alexdeejames He was a super intriguing prospect on draft day especially given his age at the time.
8,0,"@mschwartz35 He can play first and third, and the Mets recently started trying him out in left field as well."
9,0,@MartinoPuccio I didn't say for whom the 2022 debut would be.
10,0,"Catching up on minor leagues, the Mets have a really encouraging trend at Double-A Binghamton.  Mark Vientos' last 18 games: .377/.463/.884, 10 home runs  Vientos is still just 21 -- young for the level. If he keeps this up, you can pretty clearly envision a 2022 debut."

40,0,"I don't cover the Yankees, so I don't know their intricacies. But using Aroldis Chapman instead of just sticking with Chad Green for the seventh seemed questionable 10 minutes ago... and downright silly now.  Chapman is gone. Go-ahead run is in scoring position with no outs."

47,0,"This time, Brandon Nimmo doesn't leave things up to the replay gods. He swings at the first pitch and laces it into right-center for an RBI single.  And that knocks Gerrit Cole out of the game. He's getting booed by the Yankees fan base.  Yankees 4, Mets 3, top four."

83,0,"All told, another strong outing from Taijuan Walker:  5.2 IP, 2 H, 1 ER, 2 BB, 5 K, 106 pitches. He's responsible for one man on base.  Walker's 2.33 ERA ranks eighth in the National League. We'll find out this week if that's enough to make him an NL All-Star."

92,0,"For those of you who were worried, turns out the Mets are probably better than the Yankees.  Francisco Lindor draws a bases-loaded walk and Dominic Smith follows with a two-run double.  Mets 6, Yankees 0, top six."
93,1,"Brandon Nimmo with a three-hit day in his first game back from the IL -- two of those off lefties. If Nimmo had enough plate appearances to qualify, his .446 OBP would lead the Majors, just edging out Vladimir Guerrero Jr."

116,0,"Jose Peraza's line drive to the left-field wall, interrupted by catch interference, was ruled a two-run double. Then Brandon Nimmo cleared the bases with a two-run single.  So, the Mets have taken a 9-5 lead over the Yankees in the seventh. They are three outs away from a W."

118,0,"Still confused why Mets third-base coach Gary DiSarcina put up the stop sign for Michael Conforto at third base on Kevin Pillar's single. Gleyber Torres was backpedaling toward the ball. There maybe wouldn't have been a throw home, even. And on no outs? Odd decision."

121,0,Pete Alonso had a blast as he rounded the bases on a game-tying home run to left field off Aroldis Chapman.  Another Yankees' tragedy is the Mets' gain. Game tied at 5-5 in the seventh and final inning of this early doubleheader.
122,0,Today was the first time in Marcus Stroman's career that he recorded no strikeouts in an outing where he pitched at least two innings.
123,0,"Stroman surrendered his third earned run of the afternoon on a wild pitch, which could end up being the difference in this seven-inning game.  Mets trail Yankees 5-4. We head to the sixth."

217,0,"@turf_burner @AstrosFuture They could do that if they recalled them first, which would guarantee them MLB pay/service time while out. Teams generally don't want to do that. The 60-day IL is a major league IL. If you're injured while in the minors, you're a minor leaguer for IL purposes."

231,0,@kocherk11 No. I think they'll drop back down to a five-man rotation.

269,0,"Jose Altuve's walk-off grand slam was the first by an Astros hitter since the 2011 season. That one was hit by Brian Bogusevic. Altuve played in that game, too; he was about a month into his major-league career.  https://t.co/3wzs6AmK79"
270,0,The Astros didn't have an extra-base hit tonight until there were two outs in the 9th. Then ... Carlos Correa homered with two strikes to send it to extras and Jose Altuve walked it off with a grand slam in the 10th.
271,0,"@mhatter106 He didn't. Papierski did. And to the second question, what do you think? Haha."
272,0,"@ChiandPato It's everywhere. I don't know how anybody could claim with confidence that the crackdown will impact Team A this much and Team B to some lesser amount. Everyone is going to be studying spin rates to look for drop-offs now, though, so we'll have some data on individual pitchers."
273,0,"In addition to Lance McCullers, Jason Castro was also activated today. Nivaldo Rodriguez and Garrett Stubbs were optioned to Triple A."
274,0,"@d1owls4life I agree, though against the Orioles/Tigers there is less of a chance that it matters."
275,0,"Also, there‚Äôs a chance that the pitching matchup for the finale of the Astros-White Sox series will be McCullers vs. Keuchel. üëÄ"
276,0,"So basically, if all goes according to the Astros' plan, it‚Äôll be McCullers/Odorizzi and Greinke in the Rangers series and then Urquidy, Garcia, Valdez and McCullers in the White Sox series with Odorizzi rejoining the rotation for the first Orioles game."
277,0,Lance McCullers will return to the Astros‚Äô rotation Tuesday vs. the Rangers. He‚Äôs been out since May 22 because of shoulder inflammation.  Dusty Baker said Jake Odorizzi will piggyback with McCullers on Tuesday. Sounds like it'll be a temporary 6-man rotation the following turn.
278,0,"@noons2004 @ScottJ794 Ok, let's say the call was correct. I think the better question is: should it be correct? Does applying the IFR on balls in the outfield (not even shallow center, I'd argue) make sense re: the spirit of the rule?"

295,0,"@mhatter106 @RoundRockTim @CWR4 Dunno. Sometimes that happens on the schedule. Like when the Dodgers had the recent getaway night game at MMP before flying back to LA. I'm not sure the rationale by the schedule makers when they do that in non-national TV game scenarios, though."
296,0,@RoundRockTim @CWR4 Dusty said before Wednesday's game that he would probably give Brantley off on Thursday.
297,0,@srlyujest I think a good bit of time. Because of his stuff. He was bad last season but it was a weird season and a small sample. Even the inconsistent 2019 version of him would be one of their eight best relievers right now.
298,0,"@srlyujest I'm not sure about his command/control either, but he's definitely going to pitch for the Astros again."

312,0,"The Cubs are just the 3rd team in the Live Ball era (Since 1920) to go 20 consecutive games with 8 or fewer hits (had 7 today).  1972 Mets went 20. Only the 1968 Yankees had a longer streak, 22 games."
313,0,@theRfreeman I mean unless they are within a 3 games of first they will. But even then I might consider depending on the record. You have ONE shot to remake your team.

338,0,"The Cubs have struck out 92 times during their 7 game skid, most in a 7 game span in franchise history."
339,0,@Strings4life33 exactly. This isn't on Ross. Narrow thinking if you're looking in that direction

343,0,"The Cubs lost 2-1, now 7.5 games out of first place after their 7th consecutive loss.  Per @ESPNStatsInfo: The Cubs have had 8 or fewer hits in 19 consecutive games, the longest such streak by any team since the 1972 Mets did so in 20 straight."
344,0,@MikeSugar_07 You're combining two thoughts. Ross doesn't make roster decisions. Def can argue whether he should have been in the game though. vs Votto? Whoof
345,0,Great starting pitching for the Cubs and Sox tonight. Alec Mills deserved better but he can't win. Lance Lynn can.  Navigated around a bunch of traffic. Nice final start before all-star bids are announced this Sunday. ERA: 2.02

361,0,"Per @ESPNStatsInfo: The Cubs are the 5th instance over the last 40 seasons of losing by 8 runs after leading by 7. That's out of more than 16,000 instances of a team holding a 7-run lead over that span."

365,0,"@dainerrr8 @DOM_Frederic @philhand13 There were just too many variables this year. That's the answer to everything. Yes, there is always a shot at shocking the world but so so slim WHEN THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF A TEAM IS YOUR WEAKEST LINK."
366,0,"@DOM_Frederic @philhand13 Don't want to go down a rabbit hole but you're kind of saying if they had a diff roster, things would be different. Which of course is true but this IS their starting staff. And in this ONE year, cause of all the FA, you have to judge differently. Too long for twitter. No worries"
367,0,"There's a lot of these to wade through: Over the last 50 seasons, only one team has scored 7 runs in the first inning and went on to lose by 7+. That was the Giants on April 26, 1976."
368,0,"@philhand13 @DOM_Frederic Now, now, let's not pile on. These things happen. That's why I'm here, to take the emotion out of it. Only been covering these guys for a decade! Kind of know the deal. July will be better! (Has to be)"
369,0,"Ok, maybe it can. 14-7 now after a grand slam by Willy Adames. Wow"
370,0,"Ok, it can't get this bad (right?) Per @ESPNStatsInfo: On July 8, 1990, the Angels took a 7-0 lead on the Brewers and proceeded to lose 20-7; that's the worst loss by a team that led by 7 over the last 40 seasons."
371,0,Teams with a 7-run lead this season are 234-1 (.996) entering today.
372,0,"Up 7-0 after a half inning, the Cubs now trail 8-7 to the Brewers in the 4th."
373,0,@CrazyCubsGuy I never thought they were trying to win this year so signing Lester was more about letting him win his 200th in a Cubs uniform as he wanted.
374,0,Wait. Craig Counsell pinch hit pitcher Eric Lauer and Rex Brothers walked him to open the 3rd inning in a one run game. Sounds about right.
375,0,FROM ELIAS: Aaron Ashby is the first starter since the mound went to its current distance in 1893 to pitch fewer than 1 IP and allow at least 7 runs in their MLB debut.
376,0,"Now that's 7-6, I'll just put this here: Since 1900, the Cubs are 15-0 when scoring 7+ runs in the top of the 1st inning."
377,0,What a disaster of a start for Jake Arrieta. It's now 7-5 Brewers in the 2nd. Taylor Gushue takes over at first in his MLB debut after Wisdom got hurt. The Cubs were playing two short today already. Gushue has played 9 games at first in the minors in his career.
378,0,The 81 total pitches in the 1st inning between the Cubs and Brewers are the most in any MLB game this season

388,0,@mwolf4400 Haha. That cracked me up. Crazytown
389,0,David Ross said both Bryant and Rizzo took some swings and neither could give it a go late hence Lobaton getting an AB v Hader with the game on the line.
390,0,5 straight games with 12 K is tied for the 2nd-longest streak. The 2010 Diamondbacks did it in 6 games in a row.

412,0,"This series ends how it started.  El√≠as D√≠az walks it off, this time by roping a single in the bottom of the ninth to score Josh Fuentes.   The Cardinals lose, 3-2, and go 5-8 over a 13-game stretch vs. opponents under .500."
413,0,You had to know a one-run lead wasn't going to hold here. You also had to know two runs weren't going to be enough either.   The Rockies knot the game at two apiece in the eighth thanks to a sac fly from Trevor Story.

451,0,Bader's first career grand slam puts the Cardinals up big time.   Welcome back.

453,0,"Moments after a ""Let's go Yadi"" chant breaks out *at Coors Field* he shoots a single up the middle to score Carlson.   And, bc you're prob gonna need more than one in these extra-inning situations, Tommy Edman tacks on another one with a single of his own.   Cardinals up, 5-3."
454,0,"Not-so-free baseball.  To the tenth we go. Carlson will represent the runner at second base.   Goldschmidt, Arenado, Sosa due up."
455,0,@MADinSTL Great point!
456,0,"You can turn your TV's back on.   Down to the Cardinals' final strike, Jos√© Rond√≥n rips a game-tying pinch-hit single. Huge moment for an offense that has lacked that ""big hit"" for a while now."
457,0,Well if that wasn't the most symbolic play of the Cardinals offense this last month idk what is.
458,0,"John Gant, official pitcher of multiple roles, relieves Cabrera with one on and one out, surrenders a single, and fires back with back-to-back K's in the eighth.   Molina, Edman, DeJong represent the Cardinals last chances. #STLCards"
459,0,"Pivotal moment in the game here as G√©nesis Cabrera comes in to face Charlie Blackmon with two on and two out, B7. After an 8-pitch battle, Cabrera freezes Blackmon with a 97 mph heater for a called strike three.  Threat neutralized. Cardinals have six outs to score."
460,0,"Neither of the Rockies starters this series (Antonio Senzatela and Chi Chi Gonzalez) issued a walk in their outings. As Adam Wainwright noted yesterday, you just can't walk batters at Coors Field, and they certainly are adhering."
461,0,"@franze98 No, because that is so laughably untrue."
462,0,"Oviedo put on a solid showing at pitcher dreamland Coors Field, but the opportunity for his first big league win eludes him once more.   He allowed three earned runs on seven hits, struck out two and most notably walked just one batter. That'll play, with run support ........"
463,0,"Paul DeJong splits the gap for a one-out double in the 7th as the Cardinals trail, 3-2. It's been a frustrating first half of the season for him, but he's logged hits in 6 of his last 7 games.   Needless to say, if he can get going, that would lengthen the lineup tremendously."
464,0,"O'Neill has left the game.   Sosa will enter and play 2B. Edman will move to RF, Carlson to LF.   When we know more, you will too."
465,1,"Tyler O'Neill was hit by 90 mph fastball near his right wrist/bottom of hand area, but after a lengthy look with Mike Shildt and Adam Olsen, remains in the game."
466,0,"Last night's hero, El√≠as D√≠az, just uncorked a solo dinger so hard Tyler O'Neill didn't even turn around.   This game is tied."
467,0,"Yes, May 28 v. Arizona and a couple of weeks ago when he shoved seven scoreless against Miami.   Oviedo himself has not recorded a win yet, though."
468,0,Yadier Molina's two-run homer in the second is his first one at Coors Field. He has now homered in every active NL park in the regular season.
469,0,"He needed that one.  After Tyler O'Neill's leadoff double, Yadi puts the Cards up 2-0 by slamming a homer an estimated 433 feet. #STLCards"
470,0,"@Jeff82892806 Gio has been phenomenal all year. Misplaced slider for sure, but I think the frustration from yesterday‚Äôs loss stems more from the teams trajectory the last month than the pitch itself."
471,0,Cardinals top prospect Matthew Liberatore is not on the roster.
472,0,"Wainwright: ""It doesn't surprise me when I do well. It seemingly it surprises everyone else. But that's fine.   It does not surprise me because that's what I expect to do."""

474,0,@bylindsayhjones But did Lina have a good time??
475,0,"Well that's that. Giovanny Gallegos, usually both steady and reliable, gets the first two outs in the ninth, walks the next two batters, and serves up a no-doubter walk-off three-run homer to El√≠as D√≠az.  Rockies beat the Cardinals, 5-2."
476,0,"Adam Wainwright's final line: 8 IP, 6 H, 2 ER, 1 BB (!), 4 K, 1 HR on 110 pitches, 71 for strikes.   All five of his starts in June qualified as quality starts. He starts July with his sixth-consecutive. #STLCards   Gallegos and Sosa in on the double-switch."
477,0,"And he notches a 1-2-3 inning.   Wainwright has completed eight innings (at least) for the fourth time this season, and the first time since a 2-1 loss to the Cubs on May 23.  Absolutely remarkable, but after all he's done, is it even surprising?"
478,0,Tyler O'Neill misses a go-ahead HR by about two feet.   Adam Wainwright is back in for the eighth.
479,0,Adam Wainwright is through six innings of two-run ball on 85 pitches and is batting for himself in the top of the seventh. He has gone at least six innings in every start since May 29.
480,0,Paul Goldschmidt continues to spray the ball. He singled to right in his first AB. He belted one out of the park in his second. #STLCards
481,0,"Adam Wainwright hangs one and Brendan Rodgers did not miss it. Not even by a little bit.   2-1, COL."

511,0,"Here‚Äôs why baseball is so great &amp; why players/managers/GMs preach patience in a long year:  Nats went into play on June 13 in last place in the NL East, 8.5 games out of first &amp; 9 games under .500.  2.5 weeks later, they‚Äôre in 2nd place in the NLE, 2 games out &amp; 2 games over .500"

513,0,What a birthday present! Trea Turner has the cycle on his 28th birthday.
514,0,Birthday boy Trea Turner is now 3-for-3 with a homer today. This offense is coming alive.
515,0,"Bob Henley did his sneaky send right there, discreetly waving Josh Bell in instead of the full arm wave. And it stole the Nats a run. Manuel Margot came up and didn‚Äôt see a big wave, so he lobbed a throw into second. Nats are pouring it on here early."
516,0,@Nationals @BetMGM Any statistical evidence to support this move? Anything at all?
517,0,Nationals prospect Cade Cavalli has been selected to the Futures Game. The 22-year-old righty leads minor league baseball in strikeouts with 88. In 52 1/3 IP. That‚Äôs a lot of Ks in not a ton of innings.
518,0,@MarkZuckerman Jinx.
519,0,How many teams would (or can) pinch hit for their No. 1 and No. 2 hitters back to back? The Rays are such an interesting ballclub.
520,0,This is absurd.
521,0,Victor Robles homers. His first of the year. Eight Nats have batted. Three have homered. Two have doubled.
522,0,Schwarber homers.  Trea doubles.  Soto homers.   It‚Äôs 3-0. This team is so much fun to watch right now.
523,0,This is NUTS. Absolutely NUTS.   -Seven leadoff homers in 18 games.  -16 homers in 18 games (with a whole 8 innings left) -12 homers in 10 games  Kyle Schwarber is on another planet.
524,0,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
525,1,"Here is the group the Nats projected to have at the back end of their bullpen this season, w/ their current status:  Brad Hand - Active Daniel Hudson - Injured List Will Harris - Injured List Tanner Rainey - Injured List Kyle Finnegan - Injured List  Forcing new guys to step up."
526,1,"Nats have placed Tanner Rainey on the IL with a stress reaction in his right tibia. Also have DFAd Justin Miller. Ryne Harper comes back up, and lefty Kyle Lobstein also joins the bullpen from Triple-A Rochester"
527,0,"Just chatted w/ former Nat Daniel Murphy, who had that epic 2015 run of 6 straight playoff games w/ a HR. Asked him his take on his former Cubs teammate Kyle Schwarber‚Äôs insane HR barrage.  ‚ÄúYeah, they should pick a fight with somebody else right now. Like, don‚Äôt pitch to him!!‚Äù"
528,0,Ryan Zimmerman. First pitch. Three-run SHOT. What a night for the Nats. Five homers.
529,0,HE DID IT AGAIN THIS IS THE MOST INSANE THING I‚ÄôVE EVER SEEN
530,0,Paolo Espino is done after 5 scoreless against the Mets. Gets a handshake and a hug from Davey. His ERA is down to 2.02. He‚Äôs been the unsung hero for this team this season.

533,0,@LONTDC1 So amazing I now just find myself laughing at every homer
534,0,"Ok, so Schwarber:  -Now has the most HR by any Nats player in any month in team history, with 14 -Now has 6 leadoff homers in 17 games in the leadoff spot -Now has 14 total homers in his last 17 games   That‚Äôs all very good. #analysis"

545,0,@MarkZuckerman Ahhhh the good old days

547,0,Here‚Äôs a #coolstat from @KyleBrostowitz: Kyle Schwarber‚Äôs 8 HR in a 5-game span are tied for the second-most in MLB history. Trails just Shawn Green in 2002.
548,0,TWELVE HOMERS IN HIS LAST TWELVE-PLUS GAMES I CAN‚ÄôT BELIEVE THIS
549,0,OH MY GOD WHAT IS GOING ON HE DID IT AGAIN
550,0,"And his first homer of June didn‚Äôt come until June 12. He might break the team record for homers in a month, and he didn‚Äôt homer the first 37 percent of the month."
551,0,"Kyle Schwarber homers, Yan Gomes throws out a runner trying to steal. Groundhog Day."
552,0,Schwarber has 11 homers in his last 12+ games. Five of them have been leadoff homers. What he‚Äôs doing is absolutely ridiculous.
553,0,OH MY GOD KYLE SCHWARBER HAS DONE IT AGAIN

560,0,Game of the year. What a win.
561,0,"@Nationals This is very good, you guys"
562,0,That right there is an all-around gutsy win.   The Nats have won 8 of 9. They‚Äôve won 10 of 13. And they‚Äôre now just four games back of the Mets for first place.
563,0,"@DogearedCarrie Haha thanks, Carrie!"
564,0,Josh Bell has done a very nice job defensively at first base this year. That‚Äôs the tweet.
565,0,The Scherzer family is on fire tonight.
566,0,"There are so many amazing parts to this, but my absolute favorite is Jim Hickey giving an, ‚ÄúOh no, hold me back!!‚Äù sort of deal to Joe Girardi."
567,0,"Girardi then came marching out of the Phillies dugout screaming, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go!!‚Äù Essentially telling Max and the Nats to come get him."
568,0,"Max gets to his dugout after his five innings of work. Looks back to Joe Girardi in the Phillies dugout. Holds up his glove and his hat as if to say, ‚ÄúSee?!?! I‚Äôve got nothing!! Look!!!‚Äù"
569,0,"Davey is really upset. Max has already been checked twice. Girardi asked for him to be checked during an inning. Max spiked his glove and hat when the umpires came out, saying, bring it on."
570,0,"Joe Girardi is asking for Max to be checked during an inning right after a strikeout.   Max is pissed. Keeps saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got nothing!‚Äù"
571,0,"Bryce homered off Max in their first battle tonight.   Max strikes out Bryce on a cutter down and in to end their second battle. After the K, Bryce shouted out at Max, ‚ÄúWhat a pitch!‚Äù He then winked at his former teammate.   Good, clean fun."
572,0,Rhys Hoskins just doubled to right off Scherzer and lifted his arm up towards his dugout. I thought he was about to motion that he wanted them to keep the baseball. He had been 0-for-21 with 12 Ks career off Max before that AB.
573,0,"I knew Max Scherzer would be entertaining as all hell when getting inspected by umpires for substances after an inning. He did not disappoint. Guys in the Nats‚Äô dugout laughing watching Max, arms outstretched, with a stink face, get his glove and cap looked at."
574,1,Nats activate Max Scherzer from the IL. He‚Äôll start tonight in Philly. Kyle Finnegan lands on the IL with a left hamstring strain.

577,0,"After being in an empty ballpark last year, watching games being played with fake crowd noise in the background and cardboard cutouts in the seats, days like today just feel so good. 30,000-plus in the seats. Baby Shark. Standing ovations. Curtain calls. What a day."
578,0,WHAT IS GOING ON KYLE SCHWARBER HOMERED AGAIN
579,0,"Can‚Äôt make this stuff up. Gerardo Parra pinch hits in the 7th, Nats Park gets to do Baby Shark for the first time since Game 5 of the World Series, and then Parra ropes a double into the left field corner."
580,0,Kyle Schwarber has done it again. Unbelievable. Four homers in his last two games. Eight on the homestand.
581,0,"I‚Äôm choosing to believe Zim just kept walking onto the field with his arms outstretched like that. It didn‚Äôt happen, but I‚Äôm choosing to believe it did."
582,0,@MarkZuckerman WOW THANKS MARK
583,0,@chelsea_janes #ChelseaFactor
584,0,Kyle Schwarber is on another planet. His fourth leadoff homer of the season. Unreal.
585,0,"I asked Parra whether he would still be giving ling hugs to Stephen Strasburg. As I asked it, Strasburg was walking by.   ‚ÄúI hope not,‚Äù he said with a smile."
586,0,"Most important update of the day: Gerardo Parra says he‚Äôll be keeping the same Baby Shark walk-up song. Says it‚Äôs good vibes for teammates and the fans, and he wants to keep it for everyone."
587,0,Baby Shark is back. The Nats have activated Gerardo Parra.   Luis Garc√≠a has been optioned. Ben Braymer DFAd.
588,0,Let‚Äôs run this back. Schwarber does it again. Three-run shot.   He now has homered 28 times in his career in games started by Lester.
589,0,"It‚Äôs a Jon Lester start day, so that means Kyle Schwarber will homer at some point. Only took three pitches tonight.   And that was a BOMB the other way."
590,0,"@MarkZuckerman At no point did I ask you to join the pregame show. And yet, here you are. #clarification #accuracy"
591,0,"Need this guy back at Nats Park ASAP. Got the crowd so fired up, and believe me when I tell you he got the Nats‚Äô dugout fired up too."
592,0,Best I‚Äôve ever looked.
593,0,Erick Fedde over his last three starts:  -7 scoreless -5 scoreless -7 scoreless  And that‚Äôs with nearly a month-long gap in between starts 1 and 2 because of a stint on the Covid IL. Add in an inning in a previous outing and it‚Äôs 20 straight scoreless frames. So impressive.
594,0,*clears throat*

604,0,Tim Hill back into the MLB lead with his 40th appearance.  He enters with bases loaded and two outs in the seventh inning of a tie game.
605,0,Tommy Pham is now 5-for-11 as a pinch-hitter this season.  He and Manny Machado are also absolutely fearless with two strikes.
606,0,UPDATE: Manny Machado was not wearing the gold shoes before the rain delay. He is wearing the gold shoes now.
607,0,The rain and Eric Hosmer end Luis Castillo's no-hitter in the fifth inning.
608,0,Luis Castillo has been warming up. Ryan Weathers has not. It appears Mason Thompson will be the Padres pitcher to start the fifth.

611,0,"Cincinnati brings the rain hard. It‚Äôs impressive. By the way, Luis Castillo has not allowed a hit through four innings. Radar indicates this torrential downpour will pass soon.  https://t.co/Q0BfOs08Bj"
612,0,The last play before the delay. I'll remember it fondly while I watch rain fall ... again.
613,0,The tarp is going on the field. The only game in the series to start on time will have a delay.
614,0,Sometimes it is easy to take Manny Machado's defense for granted. Not when he throws all the way across the diamond from one knee to get an out.

629,0,"Trent Grisham lines a grand slam to put the Padres up 7-5 in the fifth. Almost as soon as he crossed home plate, lightning flashed across the river in Kentucky."
630,0,"Tim Hill is warming up ... for the 1,000th time this season."
631,0,Fernando Tatis Jr. sends the first pitch of the third inning to the second deck beyond left field. His 26th of the season and the third solo shot by the Padres tonight. They trail 4-3.
632,0,Trent Grisham and Wil Myers go back-to-back and have halved the Reds' lead. 4-2 in the second.
633,0,"Joe Musgrove threw 37 pitches in the first inning. The only pitcher to throw more in an inning this season was Blake Snell, who threw 38 while not making it out of the first inning April 13 at Pittsburgh."
634,0,Joe Musgrove has thrown 28 pitches and has runners at the corners with one out in the first inning. He (and the Padres bullpen) could really use a double play grounder.
635,0,Padres place Blake Snell on IL with illness. He does not have to remain there for 10 days. Seems he could pitch as soon as Sunday.  https://t.co/rzIEufUh7K

648,0,Eric Hosmer was ejected (from the dugout) for yelling at home plate umpire Hunter Wendelstedt on a strike call on Tommy Pham. Hosmer was upset about a ball called a third strike last inning.

650,0,"Before the game, I said, ""What's happening, Tommy?"" He looked at me and said this: ""I gotta get two here.""  Halfway there. His homer starting off the fourth puts Padres up 4-1."
651,0,Craig Stammen gets through the second inning on six pitches. He has thrown 28 pitches through two. Padres up 3-1. He did his job. Nick Ramirez has stopped warming but appears to be going over hitters with bullpen coach Ben Fritz.

658,0,"How Blake Snell being scratched affects the Padres' rotation plans isn't known.  However, Ryan Weathers is still expected to start at some point on this six-game trip. Chris Paddack threw his bullpen today, which lines him up to start Thursday. But that could change."

854,0,"FINAL: Mets 10, Yankees 5  WP: Jeurys Familia LP: Aroldis Chapman  üì∞ Pete Alonso hit a game-tying homer, and the Mets hardly needed a fan-interference double to prove they're the best team in New York.  üìä Record: 43-36 üìà Streak: W2 üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Pace: 88-74  Next: July 4 @ NYY, 7:05 p.m."
855,0,"Officially, it's a fan interference double. Two RBI for Jos√© Peraza on this crazy play, then Brandon Nimmo adds two more with a single. The Mets will surely take it.  Mets 9, Yankees 5, top seven.  https://t.co/pcFfqcmk9A"
856,0,Oh my God we have a Jeffrey Maier situation at Yankee Stadium.
857,0,"Pete Alonso leads off the seventh with a game-tying homer off Aroldis Chapman. Yankee Stadium is going nuts...and not because of the Yankees fans.  Mets 5, Yankees 5, top seven.  https://t.co/BKtfeGxwwg"
858,0,Gerrit Cole has allowed as many earned runs in his last two starts as Jacob deGrom has allowed all season.
859,0,"And now Francisco Lindor ties it with an RBI single. Six of the first seven hitters in the fourth inning have reached base.  Mets 4, Yankees 4, top four."
860,0,@RichardStaff @sschreiber13 enough with the bullying
861,0,"Dominic Smith stays hot with a classic Yankee Stadium homer off Gerrit Cole to the short porch in right.  That's Smith's third homer in his last 13 innings.  Mets 1, Yankees 0, top one.  https://t.co/JOLKEOw5Kt"

864,0,"Providence started its 2022 recruiting class Monday with a commitment from Tennessee guard Quante Berry. He selected the Friars ahead of fellow finalists Tennessee, South Carolina, Texas A&amp;M and Virginia Tech. #pcbb   https://t.co/MVwQJBrEop"
865,0,"Indeed, it wasn't a good performance from plate umpire Alfonso Marquez last night during #RedSox-Angels. Players, benches and @NESN broadcast team were questioning him in real time.  https://t.co/naqvR2kk0A"
866,0,Ottavino on Arroyo's positioning -- 'I knew he was over there. I always check the shifts.'  Ottavino said he stayed with the slider to Ohtani in part because he wanted it pulled into the #RedSox defense.
867,0,Adam Ottavino on facing Shohei Ohtani with the game on the line -- 'I was trying to avoid ever getting to that point.' #RedSox
868,0,Cora said it was a scheduled off day for Verdugo. Will play Tuesday and Wednesday. #RedSox
869,1,Cora on Marwin Gonzalez (right hamstring) -- 'Hopefully it's not an IL thing.'  Gonzalez likely to be down at least Tuesday. #RedSox
870,0,"If it's the final game of a playoff series or a September regular season game they really needed, Vazquez would be catching.  You can do this in Games 75, 81 and 87 of the regular season. It's normal. #RedSox"
871,0,Cora said Barnes and Hernandez were both down tonight. #RedSox had a short bullpen.
872,0,"Cora, who debuted with the Dodgers, on the Ohtani Effect -- 'I played in Southern California for a while. I've never seen fans show up to the ballpark so early and stay until so late in the game.' #RedSox"
873,0,Alex Cora said Christian Vazquez will have the day off Tuesday. Scheduled rest. Shouldering most of the work with Connor Wong currently serving as his backup. #RedSox
874,0,Shohei Ohtani hit a topspin liner into the shift on a hanging slider (5). #RedSox are fortunate he didn't crush it to Culver City.  https://t.co/F8Abm5C6mS
875,0,BOS  5 LAA  4 Final  #RedSox are 54-32.
876,0,Adam Ottavino did not end this with David Fletcher. He singles to left. The tying run is at second base.  Here comes Shohei Ohtani. #RedSox
877,0,Jose Rojas into left. It's 5-4.  The leadoff walk. It seems to never fail.  It would behoove Adam Ottavino to end this with David Fletcher. #RedSox
878,0,Juan Lagares missed that pitch by a legitimate three feet. Adam Ottavino dialed up the A+ slider there. #RedSox
879,0,Adam Ottavino does indeed have the 9th. #RedSox
880,0,"Keeping Barnes down for two days, pitching him Wednesday and then having another (scheduled) off day Thursday would seem ideal. #RedSox"
881,0,"The Angels are missing some of their typical guys (Trout, Rendon, Upton). Fine. Certainly makes a difference.  Josh Taylor just went 13 pitches, 11 strikes, four outs against their 2-5 hitters. He basically committed pitching assault. #RedSox"
882,0,Josh Taylor with a 26th consecutive scoreless outing. He bridges 1 1/3 innings this time to the 9th.   It remains a 5-3 #RedSox lead.
883,0,"That strikeout slider from Josh Taylor to Phil Gosselin was filth. Perfect location, late action, swing and a miss. #RedSox"
884,0,Could be a tough morning for Alfonso Marquez on @UmpScorecards later this Tuesday. Multiple pitchers and hitters have a legit beef with some of his calls in Anaheim this evening. #RedSox
885,0,Ohtani's backside was in the dugout on that slider and he pops to left-center. #RedSox are through the 7th with a 5-3 lead and could avoid facing the top of the Angels order again.
886,0,"Josh Taylor summoned for Shohei Ohtani in the 7th.   Just a .444 OPS in left-left matchups against Taylor this season -- one extra-base hit, one walk in 50 plate appearances. #RedSox"
887,0,Hirokazu Sawamura missed middle-middle (3). Jose Rojas drives one out. It's 5-3 in the 7th. #RedSox  https://t.co/vv26FZ6KsD
888,0,"'Can you guys believe they keep trying to run on us?'   -- Any of the three at this point, really. #RedSox  https://t.co/4eYIO8zN36"
889,0,Max Stassi. Yet another victim for the #RedSox outfield -- Kik√© Hernandez this time.   That's all for Martin Perez after 5 1/3. He leaves an inherited runner for Hirokazu Sawamura and holds a 5-2 lead.
890,0,"Yet another assist for the outfield, this time for Danny Santana. Jose Rojas is out at the plate. Call overturned. It's still a 5-2 game in the 5th. #RedSox"
891,0,"Christian Vazquez immediately asking for a replay check on that play at the plate.   And if he did get Rojas on the chest with that tag, he's absolutely right.   #RedSox have challenged."
892,0,Danny Santana serves one into right-center. More a cricket swing than baseball. #RedSox
893,1,Right hamstring tightness for Marwin Gonzalez. #RedSox
894,0,"Ellis Burks talking about swinging 3-0 during his career. Should have done it more often -- 196 PA, 4-10, 2 2B, 3B, HR, 2.069 OPS. #RedSox"
895,0,"Rafael Devers swings on 3-0 and drives a two-run homer to right-center. It's 4-1 #RedSox in the 4th.  Dylan Bundy was pissed at Alfonso Marquez, throwing over to first -- and didn't pay proper attention to one of the most dangerous hitters in baseball."
896,0,Danny Santana to LF in the bottom of the 3rd. Marwin Gonzalez is out of the game. #RedSox
897,0,Quite the return for Christian Arroyo. He goes solo big fly in the 2nd. #RedSox
898,0,"This move with Bazardo opens a 40-man roster spot with the #RedSox.  @SoxProspects has broken down the reasoning behind the logistics here -- service time considerations, etc."
899,1,"#RedSox officially reinstate Christian Arroyo (right knee) from the 10-day IL and option Michael Chavis to Triple-A Worcester.  Boston reinstates Eduard Bazardo (right lat strain) from the minor league IL, options him to Worcester and places him on the 60-day IL."

901,0,"Arroyo on Ohtani -- 'What he's done is incredible. It's obviously unparalleled.'  'Ideally, I can't wait to see him do nothing this series.' #RedSox"
902,0,Arroyo on his two IL stints this season -- 'I play the game hard. I'm always trying to make plays. It's been freak stuff.' #RedSox
903,1,"Arroyo said the weather in Worcester made it tricky during his rehab assignment, but his four at-bats on Saturday felt like enough. #RedSox"
904,0,Arroyo said it took two days to walk normally after his collision in Tampa Bay. He started to feel better after a couple more days. #RedSox
905,0,Christian Arroyo joining us on Zoom. #RedSox
906,0,"Cora, speaking about relief pitchers being selected to the All-Star team, said he thinks Jonathan Loaisiga has been 'amazing' with the Yankees.  But the ballot tends to only feature closers. Otherwise the #RedSox would be lobbying for Josh Taylor as well."
907,0,"Cora said Sale and Seabold will both throw live BP in Fort Myers on Tuesday. Sale will work two innings, Seabold will work three innings. #RedSox"
908,0,Cora said he'll be peeking at the radar gun in Colorado and hopes Eovaldi will take it easy -- maybe 94-95 with his fastball.  But he knows differently and is expecting 101-102. #RedSox
909,0,"Cora said it 'wasn't fair' for the #RedSox to ask Eovaldi to start and relieve when he came off the IL in 2019.  His buildup and consistency as a starter has made him an All-Star for the first time, and Cora said Boston 'would love him to pitch' in the game."
910,0,"Cora on being able to keep Eovaldi healthy to this point -- 'Our training staff, they've been amazing.'  'He's not lazy. He doesn't take anything for granted.'  Cora has praised Eovadi for his conditioning since his arrival in 2018. #RedSox"
911,1,Cora said Arroyo (right knee) will be active tonight and start at second base.  Chavis optioned to Triple-A Worcester. #RedSox
912,0,Cora on Ohtani -- 'He's not the best hitter. He's not the best pitcher. But you combine everything and he becomes the best player.' #RedSox
913,0,Cora on Ohtani as an MVP contender -- 'We should make a new award for him. He's just a different breed. This is something different.' #RedSox
914,0,Cora on Ohtani -- 'To be able to be successful doing both is amazing. I'm actually in awe of what he's doing.' #RedSox
915,0,"Cora on Ohtani -- 'He's been amazing.'  Cora said facing him is like dealing with Trout -- be careful, but you still have to attack and follow the pitching plan. #RedSox"
916,0,Alex Cora batting leadoff on Zoom. #RedSox
917,1,#RedSox are making Christian Arroyo (right knee contusion) available on Zoom shortly. He is with the team as Boston begins its series at the Angels.   Activation off the 10-day IL generally follows.
918,0,"Providence is a finalist for 2022 G/F Christian Watson. Marquette, Xavier, Rutgers, Georgetown, Miami, VCU, Penn State also listed.  Watson plays at St. John's College High in Washington, D.C. Grassroots standout with DC Premier. #pcbb"
919,0,Providence is on the board in its men's basketball Class of 2022. Tennessee guard Quante Berry (@quante_berry) announced his commitment to the Friars in a Monday afternoon Instagram post. #pcbb    https://t.co/MVwQJBrEop
920,0,"Tennessee guard Quante Berry has committed to Providence. First recruit on board for the Friars in 2022. Selected them off a final list that included Tennessee, South Carolina, Texas A&amp;M and Virginia Tech. #pcbb  https://t.co/xDbZBbnqT9"
921,0,"Is David Duke making a mistake? How much could he have realistically helped his NBA future with more time at Providence?  It's one person's decision to make -- his. Not mine, not yours. And there is ample evidence to suggest it was the right one. #pcbb    https://t.co/RGjRyShHbn"
922,0,BOS 1 OAK 0 Final  #RedSox are 53-32.
923,0,Matt Barnes has the 9th with a 1-0 lead.   This is his 362nd career appearance -- his first as an All-Star. #RedSox
924,0,Garrett Whitlock has the 8th with a 1-0 lead. Likely setting up for Matt Barnes. #RedSox
925,0,Nick Pivetta gave the #RedSox exactly what they needed -- seven strong innings. Boston takes a 1-0 lead into the 8th.
926,0,"Barnes on Eovaldi's selection -- 'To have another pitcher and a catch partner, it's going to be awesome.'   'He's putting together an absolutely phenomenal year.' #RedSox"
927,0,Barnes on being the third drafted All-Star for Boston from 2011 -- 'It speaks volumes to what the organization does from the ground level up.'  'They just do an absolutely phenomenal job from the moment you set foot in this organization until the time you leave.' #RedSox
928,0,"Barnes said Cora revealed the other three #RedSox selections at a team meeting this morning.  'Just a wild moment, honestly.'"
929,0,"Barnes on how this could help his upcoming free agency -- 'It obviously doesn't hurt. But we're still trying to win ballgames here.'  'If this ends up helping, we'll just kind of cross that bridge when we get to it.' #RedSox"
930,0,"Barnes on his first All-Star selection -- 'It's incredible. This is one of the things everybody wishes they got to take part in.'  'It's super-exciting, man.' #RedSox"
931,0,Eovaldi expects to be available to pitch in the game in Denver. The #RedSox will schedule his starts and side work accordingly.
932,0,Eovaldi credits the #RedSox training staff with helping him stay in uniform throughout 2021.   'I've had a hard time staying healthy in my career. This year I've been able to stay healthy so far.'
933,0,Eovaldi -- 'It's awesome. It's a big honor.'  'It's a big thing for me for sure.' #RedSox
934,0,"Matt Barnes, Nathan Eovaldi and J.D. Martinez will join #RedSox teammates Xander Bogaerts and Rafael Devers at the All-Star Game.   Barnes becomes the third member of the team's 2011 draft class to be selected (Bradley Jr., Betts).  Eovaldi and Barnes were made available pregame."
935,0,Good read here from Eric. Unconventional spring sports schedule for the #RIIL led to some things we'll (hopefully) never see again.  The state outdoor track and wrestling meets on the same day was one such occasion.
936,0,"Quante Berry will select from five finalists -- Providence, Tennessee, South Carolina, Texas A&amp;M and Virginia Tech. He's a 2022 point guard.  Berry's older brother, Tres, redshirted at #URI in 2020-21. #pcbb"
937,0,"Cora said Dalbec -- who was a good pitcher at Arizona -- is likely the best two-way player on the current #RedSox roster. He was comfortably 90 mph+ off the mound for the Wildcats, who reached the College World Series in his draft year."
938,0,"Cora on Ohtani, who will start on the mound against the #RedSox on Tuesday -- 'You can tell he's having fun doing it.'"
939,0,Cora said defense and small details in terms of manufacturing runs are among the primary areas where the #RedSox can continue to improve.
940,1,Cora said Arroyo (right knee contusion) is traveling to Anaheim today and will go through a light workout. He should be activated off the IL on Monday. #RedSox
941,0,Cora said sitting Hernandez for a few games allowed him 'to see the game from the dugout' and 'kind of slowed him down.'  Sees him controlling the strike zone better and pressing less. #RedSox
942,0,Cora said he felt like Andriese's fastball played better early in the season. They'd like to see him locate it better when he tries to go up.  Andriese has a 7.99 ERA in 16 appearances since May 1. #RedSox
943,0,"Cora expects Ottavino to be down today. Said 'it's not the perfect scenario' for Whitlock, but he could be available for one inning. #RedSox"
944,0,"Cora said it's just an off day for Bogaerts.  'He texted me this morning and said, 'I could use one today.'' #RedSox"
945,0,Alex Cora joining us on Zoom. #RedSox
946,0,"#RedSox at Oakland, Game 85 -- Hern√°ndez CF Verdugo RF Martinez DH Devers 3B V√°zquez C Gonz√°lez SS Santana LF Dalbec 1B Chavis 2B Pivetta SP"
947,0,BOS 6 OAK 7 Final/12  #RedSox are 52-32.
948,0,"Alex Cora has discussed Tanner Houck being versatile in recent weeks -- translation, a possible bullpen role.  He can't be worse than Matt Andriese. That change has to come. #RedSox"
949,0,"J.D. Martinez, folks. He'll be talking about that longer than any of his clutch hits.  I guess you can't run on any #RedSox outfielders at all."
950,0,This.....didn't work.  There's a reason why teams have A relievers and B relievers.  But those A relievers can't make 80 appearances and be effective in October. The #RedSox need more.
951,0,Alex Cora said he wants to stay away from Matt Barnes tonight. Feels like we could see Adam Ottavino or Darwinzon Hernandez in the 9th if this stays the same. #RedSox
952,0,@SPChrisHatfield I think that's a fair assessment. Just thinking in terms of comparison to the decision after 2020. He actually will have some legitimate leverage with a good year behind him and a possible 30 bidders instead of 15.
953,0,"Garrett Richards, perhaps, with a start he can build from. This has been much better. #RedSox"
954,0,"This version of J.D. Martinez makes such a difference in the #RedSox lineup.  Going to be an intriguing offseason for him. If CBA negotiations result in a universal DH, I think the 'jefe' -- how Martinez refers to his agent, Scott Boras -- will be advising his client to opt out."
955,0,And now it's good for two runs after that deep sacrifice fly to center by Renfroe. #RedSox
956,0,Gift for the #RedSox there. Devers was sleeping at first but the pickoff throw was a bad one.   Latest reminder Oakland doesn't lack for foul ground.
957,0,Danny Santana is the 24th man on this roster at best.  Dive for it. #RedSox
958,0,"Fantastic play to the glove side by Rafael Devers, and the throw across was a seed.  No more slander about moving him to 1B/DH. Leave him right where he is. #RedSox"
959,0,"Garrett Richards looked sick to his stomach there. His grip/command issues are very real, and Elvis Andrus gets hit on the helmet visor.  That's the absolute last thing Richards wanted to do, but I'm not sure how much he can prevent right now. #RedSox"
960,0,@JuniorPepen Bendiciones abuelo! She's beautiful.
961,0,"Cora on Chavis -- 'He's battling right now. I think he's done some good things for us, especially defensively.' #RedSox"
962,0,"‚ÄòAnd this is a difficult stretch for us. There's no getting around it. But nobody is running and hiding. Guys are taking the ball. We're going to do this together. If we can get into this jam together, we're going to figure it out together‚Äô   https://t.co/02iyhGR0Id"
963,1,"CLE wants to get another look at Eddie Rosario, who left tonight's game. But because it looks to be the same side/area and he's having an issue again, Terry Francona said, ""We'll probably have to IL him. But we'll get him looked at."""
964,0,"Rays come from behind to win it 9-8.   TB opened the ninth trailing 8-7. Three consecutive singles tied it, an IBB loaded the bases and Yandy Diaz grounded a ball to Cesar Hernandez, who couldn't make the throw to home.   Cleveland's losing streak is extended to seven games."
965,0,"After trailing 8-5 at one point, Rays have tied it in the bottom of the ninth and now have the winning run 90 feet away.   Against Clase, Rays open the 9th with three singles before Meadows is IBB.   It'll be Yandy Diaz vs. Clase with the bases loaded, tied 8-8, nobody out."
966,0,"Franmil Reyes has a five-RBI night, including his two-run double off the wall in right-center field.   Cleveland has stormed back from a 5-1 deficit entering the top of the fifth to now leading 8-5 in the top of the sixth."
967,0,"Cleveland tied it via a 111-mph, 2-run HR off the bat of Franmil Reyes.   Cleveland takes a 6-5 lead via a 58-mph bloop single into shallow CF off the bat of Cesar Hernandez."
968,0,"Franmil Reyes, career home runs, lowest launch angles:   T1. 5/31/19 off Caleb Smith, 19 degrees, 362 feet T1. 8/31/18 off Antonio Senzatela, 19 degrees, 425 feet T3. 5/14/19 off Clayton Kershaw, 20 degrees, 419 feet T3: Tonight off Drew Rasmussen, 20 degrees 419 feet"
969,0,"Cleveland has come back to tie it 5-5 with a four-run fifth, highlighted by Franmil Reyes' two-run laser of a HR to CF. That is Reyes' first HR since May 22 after he missed several weeks with an internal oblique strain.   That Reyes HR: 111 mph exit velo, 20-degree launch angle."
970,0,"MLB at some point needed to crack down on pitchers using sticky substances. It's also fair to point out that the league played a role in creating the problem.  On the sticky situation, the process with the baseballs and the possible solutions ‚Äî   https://t.co/NYvktg74h9"
971,0,Jose Ramirez and Shane Bieber will represent Cleveland at the 2021 All-Star Game.   It's Ramirez's third selection and Bieber's second. Bieber is still technically the reigning MVP after there wasn't an ASG in 2020.    https://t.co/JnkewNGQWL
972,0,Extra innings for Cleveland today included a costly error on Clase that allowed the go-ahead run to score and a bunt attempt gone wrong that led to a double play.
973,0,Cleveland falls to the Astros 4-3. That's six consecutive losses for CLE.  Record has dropped to 42-39 in that time.
974,0,"Ernie Clement made a nice play at third base (his second of the day after he also stole a hit from Jose Altuve earlier) to get the lead runner. But Emmanuel Clase can't handle the throw from second on a potential double play, which allows the Astros to take a 4-3 lead in the 10th"
975,0,"Cesar Hernandez gets just enough of one to muscle it out of the park, and his solo HR ties it 3-3 in the bottom of the eighth. 104.2 exit velo, 379 feet. That was HR No. 14 for Hernandez this season."
976,0,CLE falls to the Astros 6-3. Record now at 42-37 after four consecutive losses.   Story of the game: Cleveland left 15 men on base.
977,0,"Cleveland has been on the doorstep a few times but left empty handed. CLE gets on the board in the sixth with Cesar Hernandez's three-run HR, which cuts the Astros' lead in half, 6-3. 105.6 exit velo, 424 feet. That's HR No. 13 on the season for Hernandez."
978,0,"Astros piling on in the third, as a four-run inning extends Houston's lead to 6-0. Sam Hentges and Harold Ramirez both with costly misplays defensively. Hentges looked good in the first inning and it quickly went downhill from there."
979,0,"Oscar Mercado's first MLB hit of the 2021 season, after starting 0-for-9 since being recalled, is a triple off the 19-foot wall in LF."
980,1,And Cam Hill remains on the 60-day IL.   And now Jose Ramirez out tonight with elbow soreness.
981,1,"*Reyes just returning from an internal oblique strain *Plesac hurt his finger taking off his shirt *Perez had finger surgery *Bieber has a strained shoulder *Civale out w/ a middle finger injury  *E. Rosario out w/ abdominal tightness *Naylor had surgery, gruesome ankle injury"
982,1,Jose Ramirez is out of the lineup tonight with left elbow soreness. Hurt it last night diving for a ball.
983,1,"Terry Francona says everything from the MRI w/ Eddie Rosario looked OK, ""which was a relief."" Team wants to let the trainers get a better look at him.  Franmil Reyes isn't yet to the point of playing every day, but as Francona says, they'd take his bat in the lineup when they can"
984,1,La Mole is back.   Franmil Reyes has been reinstated from the injured list and is in the cleanup spot tonight as the DH.   Yu Chang has been optioned to Triple-A.
985,0,"Cleveland falls to the Astros 7-2. Record falls to 42-36. J.C. Mejia tagged for 6 ER on 5 H, 2 BB, with 3 Ks. Jose Altuve's grand slam, amidst a chorus of boos, was the decisive blow."
986,0,"Michael Brantley just crushes a ball off Justin Garza for a solo shot down the RF line. 105.7 exit velo, 402 feet.   Astros lead extended to 7-2 heading to B7."
987,1,Eddie Rosario left the game with right abdominal tightness.

989,0,"Jose Altuve thought he had ball four. He tossed his bat to begin walking to first base, but it was a called strike.   There were a lot of boo birds and some double birds."
990,0,Cleveland fans at Progressive Field have had to wait a long time to boo Jose Altuve and the Astros. They aren't letting the opportunity pass tonight.
991,1,"Franmil Reyes and Roberto Perez still have a chance to be activated off the IL on Saturday.   Team is taking a look at Bradley Zimmer's ankle. They're not sure exactly when it happened during the triple, but with a lefty on a mound today anyway, they're taking a look."
992,1,"Jose Ramirez was hit in the face w/ a foul ball, requiring a trip to the hospital. He returned during the second game and told Terry Francona, 'I'm ready to go in'  Tito: 'He's unbelievable'  On Ramirez's night and a good sign for Bobby Bradley's swing:  https://t.co/AqYlYa8226"

996,0,"Bradley Zimmer with a 109.9 mph, 415-foot triple off the wall in left-center that cuts the Tigers' lead to 2-1.   Zimmer, who has struggled mightily at the plate, also had a 110.9-mph double in the first game.   He entered today with a .578 OPS and zero extra-base hits."

1002,0,"Jose Ramirez grounded out to end the inning, but he appears to be OK after fouling a ball off his face, which seems like it would hurt a whole lot."
1003,0,Jose Ramirez is down and being looked at by a trainer. Looked like he fouled a ball off his face.
1004,0,"Bobby Bradley is swinging the bat tonight about as well as Dom drives or fights when ""family"" is on the line.   This has been a Tweet for @brianhavrilla"
1005,0,"Bobby Bradley has tied it twice tonight, both on home runs, both to left field. It's his first career multi-HR game.  HR No. 1: 107 exit velo, 430 feet HR No. 2: 107.2, 403 feet"

1007,0,"Tigers put up two against Cal Quantrill in the top of the second.   Bobby Bradley quickly ties it, drilling a 430-foot solo shot to the bleacher seats in LF. 107 exit velo.   Expected BA on Ramirez's HR: .090.  Expected BA on Bradley's HR: .950.   But they still count the same."
1008,0,"Jose Ramirez has two home runs this series, and both have been right down the RF line. This one didn't go as far, though ‚Äî¬†344 feet, exit velo 96.9, 41-degree launch angle ‚Äî¬†but it gives CLE a 1-0 lead in the first."

1016,0,"For those asking: J.C. Mejia warmed up tonight, thus the move to him starting Thursday‚Äôs game."
1017,0,"Pitching matchups tomorrow:   Game 1: Quantrill vs. Urena  Game 2: Logan Allen vs. Peralta   Allen was likely to start Thursday's game, but that has now been altered with tonight's rainout."

1029,0,"It hasn't been smooth sailing at the plate for Bradley Zimmer (.545 OPS the last two weeks), but his RBI single makes it a 3-1 game in the bottom of the second.   And as that's being typed, Austin Hedges hits a two-run HR that scores Zimmer and makes it a 5-1 lead for Cleveland."

1043,1,Austin Hedges has been activated off the concussion IL.   Ryan Lavarnway has been DFA.   Aaron Civale has been placed on the IL.   And Cleveland has selected the contract of RHP Justin Garza.

1054,0,"Cleveland wins it 4-0. Record improves to a clean 40-30. CLE now 2 games back of the White Sox in the AL Central.   Aaron Civale throws 4 2/3 scoreless innings but leaves with an apparent injury. Josh Naylor, Bobby Bradley both hit home runs."

1061,0,"Worth noting, again, that CLE's schedule during this time came with some give and take.  Give: First 7 games having to fill four rotation spots were against BAL/PIT.   Take: Only one off day between now and the All-Star break, schedule only gets tougher, other roster/lineup Qs."
1062,0,"@RoeblingOn @MeatheadReds @rijo3030 It just felt weird not to include Scott Rolen because that deal was so big, but I agree with that."
1063,0,"@EvanRVice @rijo3030 The Reds were 10 games back at the 2009 deadline, but they were only two games back earlier that July.  Also, it felt weird to not include Scott Rolen as a ‚Äúwin now‚Äù trade because of how big that move was for the Reds."
1064,0,"@rijo3030 Over the last 15 years, the Reds biggest ‚Äúwin now‚Äù trade deadline acquisitions have been Scott Rolen and Jonathan Broxton.  Right now, Trevor Story is a better player than both of them (at the time the Reds made the trade). Story would help any team that trades for him."

1073,0,"Eugenio Su√°rez made an adjustment to relax his hands at the plate, and he had a solid weekend against the Cubs.  Then, the big one against the Royals. A 431-foot bomb to left field to give the Reds a 5-2 lead."

1085,0,"No Kyle Farmer in the lineup today (he has started in 24 of the last 25 games). The Reds are facing a left-handed starter, and Mike Freeman is left-handed.   Su√°rez is the only other experienced shortstop on the roster right now, and he‚Äôs back at that position."
1086,0,This is one of the Reds more interesting lineups recently.   Eugenio Su√°rez makes his second start at shortstop since May 18. Alejo Lopez is at third.
1087,1,Michael Lorenzen continues his progression toward returning to the Reds.

1094,0,David Bell on Jonathan India: ‚ÄúHe seems to be fine. That seems to be the case a lot of the time with Jon. He wants to play. He‚Äôs tough.‚Äù
1095,0,It‚Äôs going to be a much bigger jump than this. The 16.2 percent didn‚Äôt account for today‚Äôs Reds win or today‚Äôs Brewers loss.  This was one of the biggest July weekends at GABP in a while.
1096,0,"When the Reds swept the Cardinals in early June, their playoff odds via Baseball Reference went from 4.6% to 8.2%.  This sweep of the Cubs was bigger. The Reds playoff odds climbed from 10.7% to at least 16.2% (the numbers aren‚Äôt updated yet) after beating the Cubs three times."
1097,0,"Brad Brach said he couldn‚Äôt stop smiling when on Thursday after he retired the middle of the Padres lineup as the Reds won the game.  Then in this series against the Cubs, he has retired the heart of the Cubs order twice in the eighth inning of a one-run game."
1098,0,"Javier Baez forced the ball loose with his slide at second base, so the eighth inning isn‚Äôt over yet.  Jonathan India stays in the game after being shaken up on the slide."
1099,0,"Facing a left-handed pitcher, Jesse Winker gets the job done with a 90-foot fielder‚Äôs choice that scored the runner from third.  And now a left-handed Cubs reliever faces Nick Castellanos."
1100,0,"This has ended up being very relevant.   Farmer and India were both plunked here in the seventh, and India‚Äôs hit-by-pitch ties the score at 2."
1101,0,"With a runner on first, David Bell pulls Wade Miley (91 pitches) with two outs in the seventh and Kris Bryant up.  Bryant has a hit today and a .344 average against lefties. Right-handed reliever Art Warren enters the game."
1102,0,"Aside from Jesse Winker‚Äôs double off the chair in Arizona, that 400-foot fly out by Joey Votto to the deepest part of the ball park was closest fly out to a home run that I‚Äôve seen this year."
1103,0,"Even though Wade Miley has allowed eight hits (his second-most of the year), he‚Äôs still only at 65 pitches through five innings.  The Cubs lead the Reds 2-1 in the fifth, and it could be another long start for Miley."
1104,0,"This is the best that the Reds infield defense has looked this year.  I already mentioned what David Bell was seeing from Su√°rez, there was Joey Votto‚Äôs play yesterday, Kyle Farmer has spoken about his increased playmaking at short and Jonathan India is a standout at second base."
1105,0,"Another aggressive send at third base leads to a run.  On an RBI double to left field by Tucker Barnhart, Kyle Farmer scored from first and beat the throw home."
1106,0,"The Cubs broke out of their offensive slump with an RBI single by Javier Baez in the first inning, but Eugenio Su√°rez prevented any further damage with a good double play on a ground ball up the line.  Earlier this week, David Bell discussed Su√°rez‚Äôs defense.  https://t.co/zXXYNzbCbf"

1109,0,"David Bell says Tejay Antone had a PRP injection earlier this week.  ‚ÄúAfter that, there‚Äôs a little bit of a period where you don‚Äôt do a whole lot. He‚Äôll start ramping up here‚Ä¶ He should be throwing here any day."""
1110,0,The usual lineup with the sweep on the line.
1111,0,"Joey Votto has been working on his defense recently. A lot.  Yesterday, his leaping double play brought the Reds back into 2nd place in the NL Central.  ""He works so hard on defense. It‚Äôs nice when you make a play like that that really leads to a win.‚Äù   https://t.co/0hC6knWvl0"

1113,0,"For the first time since April 22, the Reds are in second in the NL Central standings.  Over the last two games, Joey Votto led them there.   https://t.co/ScDqQK6xTm"
1114,0,The Cubs are on a seven game losing streak.  That set of circumstances leads Cubs standout closer Craig Kimbrel to the mound in the eighth inning with the Reds leading 3-2 and Nick Castellanos at the plate.
1115,0,"Sean Doolittle, Ryan Hendrix and Josh Osich have allowed one hit over the last three innings with four combined strikeouts.  They‚Äôve all pitched some of their most impressive innings of the year as the Reds lead 3-2 in the bottom of the eighth."
1116,0,This is the Reds second mid-inning pitching change of the last two innings.  This is a big game for the bullpen since the Reds have won back-to-back close games and used many of their top relievers.
1117,0,"Eugenio Su√°rez is confident in the  minor adjustments he has been making.  He hits the go-ahead single as the Reds take a 3-2 lead, and Joey Votto pointed to him after Votto scored.  Reds lead 3-2."
1118,0,Joey Votto saves a run with one of his best defensive plays of the year on a 3-6-3 double play.   He has the celebration to match the moment.
1119,0,@Kentuckinnati Second foul ball of the year in the press box.
1120,0,"With two runners on base and two outs in the fifth, Tyler Mahle reached back for some extra velocity and got a strikeout to end the inning.  He‚Äôs at 102 pitches with the Cubs up 2-1 in the fifth."
1121,0,"And the very next day, Joey Votto hits a home run to center in front of a packed GABP and cuts the Reds deficit to 2-1 in the fourth.  Over a 162 game season, if he didn‚Äôt miss time this year, he‚Äôd be on a 33 home run pace."
1122,0,"Tyler Mahle is at 66 pitches through three innings. The Cubs have put eight balls in play, and five of them have been against Mahle‚Äôs fastball."
1123,0,Kris Bryant is hitting .393 with a 1.237 OPS against the Reds this season.  Add on to that after Bryant opens the third inning with a homer as the Cubs lead the Reds 2-0.
1124,0,Tyler Mahle strands the bases loaded in the first with a swing and miss strikeout against Jason Heyward.  The Cubs now have an MLB worst .182 batting average over their last 30 games. They still rank last in runs in that stretch (86).
1125,0,"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be a part of it because, to be honest with you Charlie, I don‚Äôt consider myself a home run hitter. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd be a good representation of a home run derby, per say. I don‚Äôt look at myself as a home run hitter.‚Äù"
1126,0,Reds outfielder Jesse Winker ranks fourth in the NL with 19 home runs.   Home run derby?  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do it. I want to go watch and drink a beer and enjoy it‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm going to go watch Shohei Ohtani do it. I‚Äôm going to really enjoy all of it.‚Äù
1127,1,There was a silver lining when Eugenio Su√°rez cut his finger while barbecuing.   Here‚Äôs what the Reds third baseman is working on at the plate.    https://t.co/kDMXeTAfJG
1128,1,Reds reliever Michael Feliz is going on a rehab assignment in Louisville. The Reds claimed Feliz from the Pirates earlier this season.
1129,0,"This is the first time the Reds have used this batting order all year.   With Tyler Stephenson starting against a right-handed pitcher, he‚Äôs hitting between Votto and Naquin."
1130,0,@marksantana8 I agree.
1131,0,"@JUhlTrucker That means a lot, I really appreciate it. Thanks for following along."
1132,0,"Also, I know Frank Robinson is one of the great hitters in team history, but I didn‚Äôt realize he got hit by so many pitches.  Again, there have been 58 seasons where a Reds player was hit 10 times.  Frank Robinson is responsible for six of them."

1350,0,"Getting P√©rez back behind the plate should help the Indians' young pitching staff. Tonight, Eli Morgan will be the third consecutive rookie to start against the Astros this series."
1351,0,"Jose Altuve will get a day off tonight for the Astros. Dusty Baker has been resting a regular starter each day of this series. Thursday was Correa, Friday was Gurriel, today is Altuve's turn."
1352,1,"Bryan Abreu went one scoreless inning with one strikeout in Sugar Land last night. He'll pitch again tonight. Enoli Paredes made his second rehab appearance in Sugar Land last night, working one scoreless inning. Both retired the side in order."

1382,0,"Jake Cronenworth, Yu Darvish and Mark Melancon will join Fernando Tatis Jr. at the All-Star Game. The Padres have four All-Stars for the first time since 1998 (Tony Gwynn, Kevin Brown, Greg Vaughn, Trevor Hoffman). This year‚Äôs omissions include Manny Machado and Joe Musgrove."
1383,0,"Manny Machado has twice gotten into an 0-2 count against Vince Velasquez, once thanks to a called strike outside the zone. Both at-bats ended in a home run."
1384,1,CJ Abrams has been diagnosed with a fractured left tibia and sprained left MCL. He will miss the rest of the season. Estimated recovery is three months.
1385,0,Rain-induced weirdness: Joe Musgrove appears to be the first pitcher to get a win after a start of less than five innings since Drew Carpenter in 2009. Tim Hill got a save after pitching the fifth inning.

1406,0,"Trevor Bauer's last 21 pitches to Manny Machado have consisted of nothing but sliders. In that span, Machado has struck out twice, grounded out and crushed a 424-foot home run."
1407,0,"Jake Cronenworth hit his 11th home run, this one off Trevor Bauer. He had never hit more than 10 in a professional season. ""I think he's one of the better players in the league, period,"" Jayce Tingler said today."

1413,0,Yu Darvish tonight became the first Padres pitcher to strike out seven consecutive batters in a game since Jake Peavy in 2007.
1414,0,The Padres have made no outs and clubbed three extra-base hits against Julio Ur√≠as in the first inning. The latest was a three-run homer by Manny Machado.

1416,0,The Padres swept a four-game series against the Reds. Petco Park is back.

1418,1,"The Padres say Fernando Tatis Jr. is feeling better today and team trainers are ""encouraged."" He remains day to day."
1419,0,The Padres are recalling Nick Ramirez and Mason Thompson. This will be Thompson‚Äôs first call-up. The 2016 third-round draft pick has been closing games for El Paso.

1423,0,"What a moment for Ha-seong Kim. An eighth-inning, go-ahead home run and a Gangnam Style curtain call."
1424,1,Fernando Tatis Jr. did not feel good after diving for a grounder. A trainer and Jayce Tingler checked on him. He is leaving the game.
1425,0,"Ron Fowler is sitting by the on-deck circle, wearing a Manny Machado jersey."
1426,0,@rich_roberts It's a league-wide thing. Glasnow is an example.
1427,0,"The concern is similar to the one shared by Tyler Glasnow. To prepare for the crackdown, a lot of pitchers are ditching something as relatively tame as sunscreen and going cold turkey. Gripping the baseball differently than you're used to can affect other parts of your arm."
1428,0,"Jayce Tingler said the Padres aren't near the top in terms of sticky stuff usage. He also expressed concern about a hard-line approach to anything but rosin. ""We're coming up with some aches and pains in different spots. Is that because we're 70 games in? ... I don't think so."""
1429,0,Six Padres have homered since the start of Thursday‚Äôs game. Wil Myers has his first multi-homer game of the season.

1437,0,"Blake Snell gave up six extra-base hits, a career high. He did not make it out of the fourth inning."
1438,0,Fernando Tatis Jr. is averaging a home run every nine at-bats this season.
1439,0,"The Padres promoted righty reliever James Norwood. He made 23 appearances with the Cubs from 2018-20. In 17 innings with El Paso, he posted 29 strikeouts and seven walks."
1440,0,"The Padres plan to option Ryan Weathers to Triple A before today‚Äôs game. Interesting move that will invite questions, including this: Will San Diego have enough length in the bullpen for the time being?"
1441,0,"It‚Äôs too early for the Padres to panic. And it seems fair to wonder, more than 60 games in, especially offensively: How much of 2020 might have been an outlier?  https://t.co/xIluxPaoIW"
1442,0,The Padres had a 4-0 lead after two innings. They had their ace on the mound. Then they surrendered eight unanswered runs in one of their worst losses of the season. The Padres haven't won a series in their last five tries.
1443,0,"Trent Grisham, Tommy Pham and the Padres narrowly avoided what would've been their first shutout loss at Coors Field since 2018. They still lost, 3-2. Austin Gomber has a 0.47 ERA against the 2021 Padres. He has a 4.58 ERA against the rest of the league."

1445,0,Tommy Pham is now sporting a 111 wRC+. That's second highest among qualifying Padres.

1447,0,"It took until the sixth inning for the Padres to advance beyond first base. Tommy Pham singled for the third time today, then stole second."

1453,0,"Patrick Wisdom against the Padres this season: 7 for 17, 4 HR, 6 RBI, 2 BB, SB."
1454,0,"Tommy Pham has been San Diego's most productive player the last several days. The Padres will keep examining potential acquisitions, but if Pham keeps this up and Trent Grisham returns next week, the outfield picture suddenly looks a lot better."
1455,0,"Trent Grisham will join Triple-A El Paso in the next couple days, Jayce Tingler said. The length of his rehab assignment will depend on how he's feeling. Tingler suggested that, if Grisham feels good, it could be fairly short."

1472,0,"Jayce Tingler said he would like to get back to a six-man rotation, ""but we're going to have to wait and see how these next couple games go."" For now, Ryan Weathers, Dinelson Lamet and Yu Darvish are the next three probable starters."

1474,0,"Joe Musgrove is the first pitcher in Padres history to make a relief appearance of at least five innings without allowing a hit or a walk. He plunked a batter, like he did in his no-hitter. Jayce Tingler repeatedly praised him for resetting an exhausted bullpen."
1475,0,"Since last September, Luis Campusano, Jorge O√±a and Webster Rivas have all homered for their first career hits."
1476,0,"After three innings and seven runs off Blake Snell, Joe Musgrove is making his first relief appearance since March 31, 2019. The six-man rotation, if it could ever be called that, was short-lived."

1478,0,"Fernando Tatis Jr. and the Padres erased a 6-1 deficit and won, 11-8, in their longest game of the season. The bullpen, the team's unsung MVP, has worked 24 2/3 innings in four days. Now, who's going to pitch in relief tomorrow?"
1479,1,"X-rays on Eric Hosmer's right forearm were negative. ""Dodged a bullet there,"" Jayce Tingler said. Hosmer will be re-evaluated in the morning."

1490,0,"Dave Martinez says there will have to be some roster moves tomorrow, which he'll announce then. Otherwise said he will talk to the relievers on Tuesday about who could be available. Nationals still haven't announced a starter."
1491,0,"Nationals beat the Padres, 7-5, for a strong start to their week on the west coast. Offense and bullpen came up big to cover for Jon Lester."
1492,0,Brad Hand in with the Nationals leading 7-5. It was a winding path to get here.
1493,0,"Nine up, nine down for Wander Suero, Sam Clay and Austin Voth. The Bridge to Brad Hand is alive and weird."
1494,0,Alcides Escobar is basically on fire right now and I'm not sure what that means for the balance of the universe. Ground-rule double puts the Nationals up 7-5 in the eighth.
1495,0,Fernando Tat√≠s Jr. just made a crazy jumping catch to take a single away from Ryan Zimmerman.
1496,0,"Second double of the game for Victor Robles, and now here comes Ryan Zimmerman to pinch-hit."
1497,0,"Josh Bell was flipped to the right side and homers from the right side, giving the Nationals a 6-5 lead in the top of the seventh. Flipped his bat again, too."
1498,0,"A very sharp inning for Wander Suero, striking out Jake Cronenworth, getting Manny Machado to softly pop out in foul grounds and striking out Wil Myers. Here comes Tim Hill to match up with Juan Soto and flip Josh Bell."
1499,0,Josh Harrison seems to be 100 percent sure that he was safe at second on that steal attempt. Umps are reviewing. Harrison seems to have a point.
1500,0,"He squared twice. Pay up, everyone."
1501,0,Fernando Tat√≠s Jr. makes an error on a routine grounder and Josh Harrison reaches to begin the sixth. Who wants to bet on whether Victor Robles will push bunt here?

1504,0,@serious_jammage Was considering the seventh would be a wash
1505,0,Kyle McGowin strikes out Ha-Seong Kim to strand two runners and then screams into his glove. We're all tied up 5-5. Five innings for all the marbles at Petco Park.
1506,0,"Tie game, 5-5, after Wil Myers doubles down the left field line and Jake Cronenworth scores. Jon Lester keeps putting these team in bad spots."
1507,0,@TheRallyMullet thanks
1508,0,That's it for Jon Lester. Dave Martinez goes to Kyle McGowin with a runner on second and one out in the fourth. Lester lasted 83 pitches.
1509,0,Fernando Tat√≠s Jr. lines a homer to left field. There was no doubt. The Nationals' lead is shaved to 5-4 in the fourth.
1510,0,"Alcides Escobar keeps having productive ABs. So far tonight: Nine-pitch plate appearance to star the game, a successful safety squeeze and a single with one out in the fourth."
1511,0,@rcarlson85 Yeah that's what I'm saying with slim margin for error
1512,0,"Make it 5-3 after a two-run double for Ha-Seong Kim. Jon Lester is up to 65 pitches with two outs in the third. Starlin Castro's error hurts, but also shows how slim the margin for error is with Lester on the mound."
1513,0,"And after a dribbled single up the middle, Jon Lester's hits Trent Grisham with a 2-2 cutter and a run comes in. It is now 5-1 in the third. Looooong way to go here."
1514,0,"Starlin Castro's error is already costing Jon Lester pitches, as he walks Manny Machado with two outs to bring up Wil Myers. We'll see if it also costs the Nationals a run or two."
1515,0,Not Joe Musgrove's night. He pops up a bunt and Jon Lester catches it before doubling Victor Caratini off first. Helps keep the pitch count from ballooning further. Lester is at 41 through two.
1516,0,@TalkNats Yeah
1517,0,@SimonWDC Perhaps what?
1518,0,It is now 5-0 after Josh Bell singles in Alcides Escobar. The Nationals' dugout is fired all the way up.
1519,0,Juan Soto's sacrifice fly gets Jon Lester in. Lester calmly slides into home despite there being no throw. Nationals are ahead 4-0 while doing #TheLittleThings.
1520,0,Ahem. Now all Trea Turner needs is a double and triple. It's the second inning.
1521,0,"@johnquinn83 Means a lot, JQ."
1522,0,@Todd_Dybas I do! I love a good push bunt if the guy is a light hitter. Just need you all to stop telling power lefties to bunt against the shift and we'll be all set.
1523,0,Nationals safety squeeze with Alcides Escobar and Victor Robles running from third. It works.   Nationals up 3-0 now and have Joe Musgrove on the ropes.
1524,0,Jon Lester singles to right-center and Yan Gomes scores. Maybe all that pinch-hitting did some good in the end.   Nationals up 2-0.
1525,0,"@Todd_Dybas To be fair, $20 seems steep"
1526,0,"Victor Robles made solid contact on a foul ball and then bloops a double down the LF line, putting runners on second and third with one out. Talk about needing a hit."
1527,0,"Jon Lester started his outing with two strikeouts before issuing back-to-back two-out walks, spiking his pitch count to 29 after one. Stranded the bases loaded with a groundball to first."
1528,0,"@HGLIII Hell no. It was me running out of the way, though."
1529,0,@SimonWDC Sure but they wouldn't be automatically activated if healthy. All these others would.
1530,0,"Foul ball just landed the row in front of me, coming straight for my laptop. Time to go home."
1531,0,The Padres like to run and Jon Lester is of course susceptible to that. First stolen base of the night goes to Jake Cronenworth. We'll see if the Nationals can control it.
1532,0,@_lminmd_ Thanks for noticing
1533,0,@LONTDC1 That's what I'm here for
1534,0,On all the injured dudes in San Diego (and back home):  https://t.co/LiVV8TsBkg
1535,0,"Trea Turner is a single, double and triple away from the cycle."
1536,0,"Trea Turner crushes the first pitch he sees from Joe Musgrove to the second deck in left. Welcome back to the lineup, I guess.   Nationals up 1-0."
1537,0,"Was looking to see where the stadium shows the count at Petco, then remembered when Howie Kendrick hit a solo homer off the digital scoreboard in left, the first of back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs."
1538,0,Play ball in San Diego. The Nationals could use one.
1539,0,@TalkNats Got bumped a day for extra rest
1540,0,"As for tomorrow's starter, Dave Martinez says they will get through today and then figure it out. Martinez only floated Jefry Rodriguez as a vague possibility. If they were to look at AAA, lefty Josh Rogers would be on regular rest."
1541,0,"Dave Martinez says he was ""really shocked"" that Max Scherzer wasn't named an All Star this year.   ""He's one of those pitchers in this league where he brings it every year. He hasn't changed. He's done it again this year."""
1542,0,"Stephen Strasburg threw a 60-pitch bullpen today. So another step forward for him, conceivably, but not facing hitters quite yet."
1543,0,Dave Martinez says the Nationals have talked to Alcides Escobar about playing first base in a pinch. Nature is certainly healing.
1544,0,Daniel Hudson threw a 21-pitch bullpen today and came out okay. Kyle Finnegan played catch after throwing a bullpen yesterday. Martinez had predicted that Finnegan could come off early/middle of this week if he kept progressing well.
1545,0,Nationals lineup tonight ‚Äî Trea Turner and Yan Gomes are back in:  Alcides Escobar 2B Trea Turner SS Juan Soto RF Josh Bell 1B Starlin Castro 3B Yan Gomes C Josh Harrison LF Victor Robles CF Jon Lester P
1546,0,From the Nationals' game notes: Tomorrow's starter is TBA and Patrick Corbin (Wednesday) and Max Scherzer (Thursday) will get an extra day of rest before they pitch again. Jon Lester goes tonight in San Diego.
1547,0,@serious_jammage then someone will pay
1548,0,@AengusO12 Yes
1549,0,"Dave Martinez and Paul Lessard just walked off the field together and into the tunnel. And while those two typically have a lot to discuss, their plates are overflowing these days."
1550,0,"Hello, beautiful place.  https://t.co/ruVgfmJ04P"
1551,0,@NerdTrea You got me lol
1552,0,@Rjoequinn Ha maybe. I was trying to make the Nationals‚Äô possessive and didn‚Äôt see that I wrote Mad instead of Max. Took a nap. It‚Äôs not that serious
1553,0,"What happens when you wake up from a nap and try to tweet right away. Take three: The Nationals‚Äô All Stars are Trea Turner, Juan Soto and Kyle Schwarber. Surprisingly, no Max Scherzer."
1554,0,"@martyball98 Eh I don't know. One of the happiest moments of some people's lives. Who cares how they do it if it makes them happy and is exciting, etc.?"
1555,0,"Nationals lose to the Dodgers, 5-1, and were swept in four games here this weekend. A depleted roster made it tough to stick with LA's depth and versatility."
1556,0,Bright spot for the offense today.
1557,0,"Gerardo Parra stumbles into the wall and Max Muncy winds up with a two-run double with one out in the ninth. It is now 5-1, Dodgers leading, and Parra looks a bit shaken up. Dave Martinez is going to hook Wander Suero for Andres Machado."
1558,0,Second player of the game to be hit in the helmet by a fastball. Justin Turner seemed to turn just in time to avoid something scary on an errant pitch from Wander Suero.
1559,0,First career hit for catcher Tres Barrera.
1560,0,Max Muncy hits a double into the right-center gap and the Dodgers lead 3-1 in the seventh.
1561,0,Brad Hand is coming in to face Max Muncy and double-switches Gerardo Parra so he can get some more length here. Another sign of how undermanned this bullpen is. Dave Martinez pressing a big button to try and keep the score close.
1562,0,@MikeLeeTaylor I only meant that he is in a particularly bad slump and looks totally lost at the plate. You all need to calm down today haha
1563,0,Nationals down 2-1 now after Albert Pujols hits a pinch-hit single to the wall in left and drives in Gavin Lux.
1564,0,"@RIPFanatic82 I mean that striking out three times in three at-bats and watching a fastball down the middle is a particular type of slumping, just totally out of sorts."
1565,0,"And I should add that Pitch 6 is a fastball from lefty David Price. Nationals first had Josh Bell gamble for an extra base and get out, then Victor Robles watch that pitch after Alcides Escobar punched a two-out double to the right-center gap."
1566,0,Victor Robles is going through it right now. Took 6 for a called strike three with two outs and a runner on second. Three strikeouts in three at-bats today.  https://t.co/nNiBGq57ny
1567,0,@serious_jammage Too much practice
1568,0,"Josh Bell tries to stretch a single into a double and is thrown out at second. Looks like he may have beaten the tag with a headfirst slide but couldn't hold onto the base. Tried to switch hands at the last second, but no dice."
1569,0,"Joe Ross, man. Third career 10-stirkeout game after he gets Zach McKinstry to swing through an in-zone slider. Game is still tied 1-1 heading to bottom of the sixth."
1570,0,"Dave Martinez asks the umpires to check if there was catcher's interference on a swing by Josh Harrison. They chat and grant Harrison first base. Then Dave Roberts asks for a review, which is starting now."
1571,0,Two in two days.
1572,0,Joe Ross hitting for himself at 77 pitches in the fifth. The Nationals really could use two more clean innings from him to hide their short bench and shorten the bridge to the back-end relievers. But they also need a lead.
1573,0,Alcides Escobar stole second and then is sent back to first because it is determined that Victor Robles interfered with the catcher's throw while striking out swinging. Dave Martinez comes out to discuss.
1574,0,"Joe Ross strikes out Steven Souza Jr. to end the fourth and strand the bases loaded. Souza was unhappy with three calls (1, 2 + 6 below) but zone shows Ross dotting the corners, if only barely:  https://t.co/qlJj9foVTV"
1575,0,"Joe Ross just hit Austin Barnes in the back of the helmet with an errant fastball. Barnes was okay, having turned in time, and Ross looked immediately frustrated that the pitch got away from him. Bases are now loaded with two outs in the fourth."
1576,0,"@DCSPYDER The delay is a matter of seconds! Just don't look at Twitter constantly if you're also watching on tv, ya know?"
1577,0,"Matt Beaty takes Joe Ross deep to left-center and this game is tied, 1-1, in the top of the fourth.   Josh Bell grounded into a 1-4-3 double play with runners on the corners and no outs in the previous half. Could come back to hurt."
1578,0,Back-to-back singles for Juan Soto and Starlin Castro and the Nationals are ahead 1-0. Loud cheers all around. Is it too early to ask how they get a lead to Brad Hand?
1579,0,Phil Bickford is out after walking Josh Harrison with one out in the third. In comes V√≠ctor Gonz√°lez to match up with Juan Soto and flip Josh Bell (if the inning gets there). Starlin Castro is in between Soto and Bell.
1580,0,"@Dcwash1 Ha, quite a few, I'd say. Great job today and yesterday!"
1581,0,"I didn't realize ""questionable"" was an upgrade. Feel much better about myself."
1582,0,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo upgraded to questionable for NBA Finals   https://t.co/HodviH69cs

1585,0,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Giannis Antetokounmpo doubtful for Game 1 of NBA Finals vs. Phoenix Suns   https://t.co/VGuUqUBQVL
1586,0,Counsell said the offense just didn't put enough pressure on Mets pitchers until the ninth. Too many strikeouts -- 13 in all. Yelich and Taylor three each and Hiura four. That's 10 of them right there.
1587,0,Bradley flies out and #Brewers lost to Mets 4-2.
1588,0,"Hiura strikes out for the fourth time, and now you wonder if it's slipping away from him again."
1589,0,Diaz gets a big out by striking out Peterson for the first out in the ninth. Two on for Hirua.
1590,0,"Tyrone Taylor, who had struck out three times, singles through the left side to drive in Adames and #Brewers cut lead to 4-2 in ninth. Still no outs. Two on for Peterson."
1591,0,"Yes, Pillar made the first out. Thanks."
1592,0,"Mets bring closer Edwin Diaz in with 4-1 lead and he surrenders leadoff single by Willy Adames and walks Omar Narvaez. Just like that, #Brewers get tying run to plate with none down."
1593,0,Hunter Strickland takes over in the eighth with the bases loaded and no outs. He gets Smith to fly out to shallow RF and Alonso to ground into a DP. Great work there but #Brewers trail 4-1 going to the ninth.
1594,0,"#Brewers left Hoby Milner retires none of the three hitters he faces in the eighth. PH Guillorme singles, Nimmo singles and Lindor walks. Bases loaded with no outs as Hunter Strickland comes on in a 4-1 game."
1595,0,"Luis Urias snaps his 0-for-18 skid on the trip with a two-out single up the middle in the eighth but Yelich flies out to left and #Brewers still trail the Mets, 4-1."
1596,0,"Brandon Woodruff's pitching line doesn't reflect how dominant he was for six innings: 6.1 IP, 4 H, 4 R, 4 ER, 1 BB, 6 K."
1597,0,Miguel Sanchez retires both hitters he faces in seventh and Mets have 4-1 lead.
1598,0,They have not had a nine-game losing streak. Six is the most this season.
1599,0,"Conforto lines RBI single to send home Mets' third run of the seventh and make it 4-1. That will be all for Woodruff, who lost it in the seventh after six dominant innings."
1600,0,Alonso jumps on first-pitch fastball right down middle from Woodruff and lines it into LF corner for two-run double. Mets have 3-1 lead with no outs.
1601,0,Lindor leads off Mets seventh with a walk -- the first issued by Woodruff -- and Smith follows with single up the middle. Mets have runners on the corners with no outs in a 1-1 game with Alonso coming to the plate.
1602,0,"Brandon Woodruff at a very manageable 64 pitches as he takes mound in seventh. Has thrown 47 strikes, pounding the strike zone."
1603,0,"Seth Lugo takes over for Mets in seventh and strikes out Tyrone Taylor, who joins Yelich in the three-strikeout department. Keston Hiura strikes out to end the inning and he, too, has three strikeouts in three at-bats."
1604,0,Another 1-2-3 inning for #Brewers ace Brandon Woodruff in the sixth and it remains a 1-1 game. He has allowed one hit -- the leadoff double by Nimmo in the fourth that led to the Mets' only run.
1605,0,Loup puts #Brewers down in order in sixth with pair of strikeouts. Still a 1-1 game vs. Mets.
1606,0,"Yelich strikes out on three pitches against Loup, the last one looking. Three at-bats, three strikeouts."
1607,0,"Tylor Megill is done after five solid innings for Mets: 5 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 2 BB, 7 K. 92 pitches, 60 strikes. LHP Aaron Loupon to pitch."
1608,0,Woodruff puts Mets down in order in fifth and #Brewers and Mets remain tied 1-1.
1609,0,"Woodruff draws two-out walk in fifth but Urias grounds out to third. Urias had been swinging bat well but is having a tough road trip thus far, going 0 for 18."
1610,0,"After the Nimmo double, Lindor sacrifices him to third. Strange thing for someone like Lindor to do but it works when Dominic Smith follows with sacrifice fly to center. Mets tie #Brewers 1-1 in the fourth."
1611,0,"After nine up and nine down against Woodruff, Mets get their first baserunner when Brandon Nimmo punches an opposite-field double down LF line to open bottom of fourth."
1612,0,#Brewers strike first on one-out HR to right by Omar Narvaez in fourth inning.
1613,0,"Once again, #Brewers ace Brandon Woodruff is dealing. Strikes out the side in the third. Nine up and nine down with five strikeouts."
1614,0,Christian Yelich swings at changeup off the plate and strikes out for the second time against Megill to end #Brewers third inning. No score.
1615,0,Jackie Bradley Jr. grounds into 4-6-3 DP and #Brewers are done in the second. 0-0 vs. Mets.
1616,0,Keston Hiura swings through a couple of fastballs down the middle and strikes out after Peterson's opening walk in #Brewers second.
1617,0,"""On Base Jace"" Peterson leads off #Brewers second with a walk."
1618,0,Dominic Smith battles Brandon Woodruff for eight pitches before striking out in a 1-2-3 first inning for the Mets.
1619,0,"With two down in #Brewers first, Willy Adames doubles down LF line and Omar Narvaez is hit by a pitch but Tyrone Taylor takes a called third strike from Tylor Megill."

1626,0,Wow. Way hotter than New York City. It's 81 degrees right now in Queens as #Brewers get ready for some pregame BP before taking on the Mets.
1627,0,"Well, apparently it isn't winning in some areas. Doesn't sound that difficult to figure out a solution, does it?"
1628,0,Projected to be picked right around where they sit at No. 15.
1629,0,"Just saw a news report on COVID-19. It said the states with the lowest vaccination rates have the highest rates of new cases of the virus, particularly with the Delta variant."

1782,0,@Joshstros Dusty prefers the four-man bench.
1783,0,"Optioning three players and activating only two suggests someone else will be activated tomorrow. Bryan Abreu threw back to back days in Triple A on Friday and Saturday. He's probably ready. Joe Smith seems close, too."
1784,0,"Yordan Alvarez and Mart√≠n Maldonado will be active for the Astros‚Äô series opener against the A‚Äôs tomorrow.  Garrett Stubbs, Ralph Garza and Peter Solomon were optioned to Triple A after yesterday‚Äôs game."

1789,0,Yordan Alvarez is on paternity leave. Taylor Jones is back up from Triple A.
1790,0,What a rise by Teoscar Hern√°ndez. Signed with the Astros for only $20k out of the Dominican Republic 10 years ago. Went unselected in the 2015 Rule 5 Draft. Was traded to the Blue Jays for a rental reliever in 2017. Now a starting outfielder in the 2021 All-Star Game.
1791,0,"The Red Sox may piggyback starters or taper some of them back in the second half coming of a short season last year. Now fully healthy Tanner Houck will be in the mix.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no restriction at all with any pitches thrown. It‚Äôs Tanner Houck electricity.""  https://t.co/Kmtp2Apcd6"

1795,0,Christian Arroyo has been activated and will play second today. Michael Chavis optioned back to Worcester.
1796,0,"Rafael Devers' defense is visibly improving. He's never finished a season with a positive DRS and now owns a 3 DRS through 80 games.   ‚ÄúYou can put everything in perspective, but one of the things is consistency.""   On how he's gotten to a point:   https://t.co/dfjLQlQZUH"
1797,0,(OK time for bed how do I turn these fireworks off?)
1798,0,@Insufficientl15 haha well thanks. Defensive runs saved measures how many runs a player saves (or costs) his team relative to a league average player at his position. A positive number means he's above average
1799,0,Rafael Devers has never finished a season with a postive DRS. He currently has a 3 DRS ranking him among some of the best third basemen in the league in the midst of his first All-Star season. On Devers‚Äô markedly improved defense this year:  https://t.co/dfjLQlQZUH
1800,0,"Minor league promotions usually happen around the All-Star break. Yorke is already playing in a league above his age, but hitting so well, curious to see if he's promoted to High-A Greenville. Red Sox surprised everyone with that pick a year ago, but he's doing well so far"
1801,0,"Long, but interesting quote from Cora on the coaching staff's role in helping this Red Sox team win and how they're clicking on (most) cylinders. There's a quiet confidence they've been exuding all year, even after they lose like last night.  https://t.co/MvW7NOEanh"

1803,0,"Cora said even though Martinez doesn't play OF often, he's always on top of playing catch and long tossing to keep his arm fresh.  Cora also said the Gonzalez SB attempt was his own fault, gave the wrong sign. Said Santana's attempt was a chance they don't want to take in extras"
1804,0,That one snaps the Red Sox winning streak at eight games.
1805,0,"In his last 15 games, Kik√© Hernandez is 16-for-53 (.302) with four doubles, five homers and 12 runs driven in."
1806,0,JD Renfroe over here. This game is what you‚Äôd call nuts.
1807,0,@CealeyGodwin Haha I think they'd eventually go to Marwin since he pitched in a blowout game for them earlier this year
1808,0,@mikeMaher Agreed. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been writing and tweeting so much about it. It‚Äôs fascinating to me. And that he‚Äôs so open about it

1810,0,"Richards threw 20 changeups last start, his first using the pitch. He's thrown five tonight, first swing/miss was on the first pitch of the AB to Olson. Adding the change and curve helps mix up his sequences. Obviously this is a HUGE work in progress but 5 IP, 3 H, 1 R so far"

1812,0,Cora had thought Wednesday but sounds like Ohtani on Tuesday
1813,0,"That was Richards‚Äô first changeup tonight. He said this week that while he‚Äôs been working on that change and slow curve, the biggest challenge is having the confidence to throw them in a game. He was pretty candid and interesting in discussing all this.  https://t.co/0oyB09ycVB"
1814,0,Cora also the Red Sox might be facing Ohtani Wednesday is the Angels‚Äô rotation stays in line.
1815,1,Cora says Connor Seabold threw a live BP this past week and has been progressing well.

1828,0,Garrett Richards hasn't been shy about discussing his transition away from using sunscreen and rosin.  He detailed the process of learning how to throw a changeup and super slow curve on the fly in between starts over the past week.  https://t.co/0oyB09ycVB
1829,0,@lindseyadler Thank ya!
1830,0,@BobBradley554 Bob! Thanks so much! I remember those days (and the 19th hole) fondly. Hope you‚Äôre doing well!
1831,0,"Also in here, Richards had some interesting comments on sticky stuff:  ""Do I feel a little bit like, ‚ÄòDamn we were doing something wrong the whole time?‚Äô Yeah, I do feel that way. But in all fairness, I don‚Äôt think we knew we were doing something wrong.""  https://t.co/0oyB09ycVB"
1832,0,Talked to Garrett Richards for a while about what it's like reshaping his repertoire on the fly in between starts. Eduardo Rodriguez helped him with his new changeup and pitching coach Dave Bush has been invaluable. Inside Richards' process:  https://t.co/0oyB09ycVB
1833,1,An early July rehab assignment followed by about five starts lines up with that mid August return target
1834,0,Christian Arroyo is on the field taking some grounders before batting practice.
1835,0,"@TheVirk51 No it was never mid-July, they‚Äôd said mid summer. At this point it‚Äôs looking like mid August. If he goes on rehab assignment in the next week or and throws five starts, he could be ready early/mid August"

1839,0,"@CostaRica79 Well it is named Polar Park, so if they don‚Äôt have dibs on the goods then no one will"
1840,0,Franchy Cordero‚Äôs resurgance at Triple-A and work at a new position could help lead him back to Boston.  https://t.co/TFSMhvNR3b
1841,0,But of course the best part is catching up with @JoeyMacHockey and @BillBallouTG
1842,0,Also added perk is the free Polar seltzer in the press box.  https://t.co/C7kEcjqtIz
1843,0,"Polar Park is nice, in case you were wondering.  https://t.co/XN8hLbKo5v"
1844,0,"A new changeup, a slower curveball and a bucket of ice.¬†  That‚Äôs how Garrett Richards survived what began as an ugly start and ended in a Red Sox victory on Monday night.¬† https://t.co/AVTL31L5cv"
1845,0,"Regarding Richards' increased sinker usage, he said it's actually not a sinker but a split changeup he developed earlier this week. Savant initially read it as a sinker, but this is a completely new pitch. Richards also said he stuck his arm in the cooler so he'd stop sweating."
1846,0,"@JoeyMacHockey So, so, so many phones for high school round-ups. And plenty of agate shifts, too! Also miss (sort of) the phone calls from the regulars asking for scores of whatever random NBA or MLB game that could easily be looked up online."
1847,0,"@RecitsSox yeah I just noticed the same thing. It seems a bit wonky tonight. It had four through the first two innings, then went up to 20 by the end, now it seems like it's at 2... I'll ask  Richards says post game about it"
1848,0,"Also in here, the Red Sox only need Richards to throw one more start (July 3) before the break. His next lines up with July 8, but it's an off day. They could skip him to give him extra time on either side of the break to continue refining these pitches.  https://t.co/XUN9LenMeN"
1849,0,"@ncolby33 I don't know, I know what you're getting at, but I think they let him work through this. They really only need one more start out of him before the All-Star break then can give him like 10 days to work on things which I think could help"
1850,0,And Renfroe's second homer of the night gives the Red Sox a 6-5 lead and takes Richards off the hook.
1851,0,"Richards final line: 5.2 IP, 11 H, 5 R, 5 ER, 0 BB, 3 K. 88 pitches, 64 strikes. Threw 20 sinkers, nearly a third the number of sinkers he threw last season."
1852,0,"Cora comes to get Richards after 5 2/3 innings with a runner on first. Sawamura entering. Richards' first two innings were *brutal*, making the in-game adjustments in the third, fourth and fifth pretty remarkable."
1853,0,Garrett Richards back out for the sixth inning at 86 pitches.
1854,0,"Richards with three homers allowed in the first two innings, has settled down over the next three allowing three singles. Got Sal Perez and Emmanuel Rivera to strike out swinging on 95 mph fastballs."
1855,0,Hernandez had his pants pulled way above his knees yesterday. Today they are down.   He has hit a leadoff homer in both games.  An investigation into this matter will commence. I'll report my findings soon.
1856,0,"*four sinkers.   (Cue the joke about him already throwing a stinker.)   But either way, this is going to be a work in progress."
1857,0,"Alex Cora mentioned Garrett Richards might start throwing his sinker more, a pitch he'd only thrown 8 percent of the time last year, but 18 percent in 2019.  Entering tonight, he'd only thrown six sinkers this season. He's thrown five so far tonight  https://t.co/XUN9LenMeN"
